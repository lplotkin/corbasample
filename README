1. Install omniorb.  Omniidl should be available on the path.  On ubuntu:
	apt-get install omniorb omniidl libomniorb4-dev

2. Type 'make'

3. Run server.

	$ ./server 
	
Note the nicely quoted connection string it pukes out.  It should start with IOR and go on for a while.

4. Run the client.

	$ ./client 'connection-string-goes-here' 'string-to-reverse' 
	
in another window.  


Java part (optional)

1. Install java.  You'll *NEED* JDK-1.7 to compile and run without dicking around with modules.  Make sure java -version reports jdk 1.7.  Also make sure the server part from above is running.
   
2. Type 'make java'

3. Run the client.

   $ java -cp src/java client 'connection-string-goes-here' 'string-to-reverse'
