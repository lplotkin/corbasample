1. Install omniorb.  Omniidl should be available on the path.  On ubuntu:
	apt-get install omniorb omniidl libomniorb4-dev
   Install java.  On ubuntu:
	apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk

2. Type 'make'

3. Run server.

	$ ./server 
	
Note the nicely quoted connection string it pukes out.  It should start with IOR and go on for a while.

4. Run the client.

	$ ./client 'connection-string-goes-here' 'string-to-reverse' 
	
in another window.
